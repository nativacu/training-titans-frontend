This project is an Interview Simulator Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using the Ionic framework with React. It serves as a training tool for interviewers, allowing them to conduct simulated interviews and receive feedback on their performance. The application provides a realistic interview experience and evaluates the interviewer's performance through the use of LLMs.
